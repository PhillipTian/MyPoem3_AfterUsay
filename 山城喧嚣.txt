万里
你飘泊在千米的高岗
远方
岷江的丝带缠绕又包围着
世界小小的一方

我想把这首诗
与祖国河山捆绑
看佛寺脚下
金光万丈
——
抬头，我看看天
看看月亮
那静谧的永恒
一度消逝的希望

我的心事
都藏在这首诗
脚底的山谷
是此生茫茫的不可知！
万佛洒下光芒
没能驱散大雾
和众生轮回的迷茫
群山奋力歌唱
可惜世俗的人
再也听不见天籁的乐章

你想
借鸟儿一双翅膀
去肆意翱翔
你想
借天地无穷幻想
在江河里自由徜徉
可崇山匍匐在脚下
山里的秘密
我问
只有乌鸦的回答
从云端
扶摇而上；
晚风挟裹云雾来
自然的气息
遥远的回忆
不言
同是万物生长的模样

每个人心头
都有一首诗
它藏在美酒
或是朱砂痣
你可以
艳抹浓妆地玩世
这一份
妙不可言的安静
却无可复制……

九月
在炎热的尾巴
我就将远航
或许与他们分享
可谁又知晓
我心底的这一抹月光？
都说
在路上
没人
去期望

…………
“你是我一生的信仰
我是你日出时的彷徨”
这山这水
将永远在我的世界流淌



10,000 miles
You are drifting on a high hill of a thousand meters
far away
The ribbon of Minjiang River twists and surrounds
The small side of the world

I want to tie this poem
Tied to the rivers and mountains of our country
Look at the foot of the Buddhist temple
The golden light is so bright
--
Look up, I look at the sky
Look at the moon
That stillness of eternity
A once faded hope

The things of my heart
Are hidden in this poem
The valley beneath my feet
Is the unknowable of this life!
All Buddhas shed their light
Can't dispel the fog
And the confusion of the reincarnation of all beings
The mountains sing with all their might
But the worldly people
Can no longer hear the music of heaven

You want to
Lend a pair of wings to a bird
To soar freely
You want to
Lend the sky and the earth endless fantasy
Wander freely in the rivers
But the mountains are prostrate at your feet
The secrets of the mountains
I ask
Only the answer of the crows
From the clouds
to rise up.
The evening wind comes with clouds
The scent of nature
A distant memory
without words
The same pattern of all things growing

Everyone's heart
There is a poem
It is hidden in the wine
Or a vermilion mole
You can
Play with the world with a lot of makeup
This one
wonderfully quiet
but cannot be replicated ......

September
At the end of the heat
I'll be sailing away
Maybe to share with them
But who knows
This moonlight in my heart?
They say
On the road
No one
To expect

............
"You are the faith of my life
I am your wandering at sunrise"
This mountain and this water
Will always flow in my world
