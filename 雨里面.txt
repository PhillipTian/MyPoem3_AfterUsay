雨里面
她在竹台看月
微风匀匀
拂动谁的心弦

我在烛台一瞥
月色落下
一地思念

曾经，天空也如这般月圆
所有的心愿
都被你温柔成全

曾经，落影也如这般残缺
所有的时间
只因你而不眠

那是活在我的世界
不是醉在酒的世界
那是写在我的诗篇
不是轻易许下诺言

我，在竹台看月
雨滴落下
呼唤思念

我，望着你的眼
那遥远的回忆
还藏在天边
那远方的人
都不再眼前

雨停了
我多了一句谎言
你少了一个梦魇


Inside the Rain
She is watching the moon from the bamboo platform
The breeze evens out
Whose heartstrings are being stirred

I glance at the candelabra
The moonlight falls
A place of longing

There was a time when the sky was as full as this moon
All the wishes of my heart
Were fulfilled by you

There was a time when the shadows were as broken as this
All the time
Sleepless only because of you

That is living in my world
Not drunk in the world of wine
That is written in my poetry
Not a promise easily made

I, watching the moon from the bamboo platform
Raindrops fall
Calling for thoughts

I look into your eyes
That distant memory
Still hidden in the sky
The people from far away
Are no longer in sight

The rain has stopped
I have one more lie
You have one less nightmare
