我以为那盏灯
是你眼底的月亮
衬着一弯
浅浅的水
月光
在我心头荡漾
晚霞
在我彷徨里迷茫

沉默。沉默。
我
一副不在意的模样
也只是
试着假装
仍视你
为年少欢喜时的惆怅

I thought the light
Was the moon under your eyes
Against a curve
of shallow water
Moonlight
Swirling in my heart
The evening sun
Confused in my wandering

Silence. Silence.
I
A look of not caring
And just
Trying to pretend
I still see you
as the melancholy of my youthful joy
