枫叶红了，落了
与淅淅沥沥的思恋
怎么看
都像一首首寄出的诗篇
因为她
曾是我最美的信念

这万水千山
终究会阻拦万语和千言
再重要的人
也敌不过万里和谎言
敲着空格键
以为你会懂
——

当你望向这苍白的月
连星星也黯淡的黑夜
当你曾路过这条老街
在熟悉又陌生的世界

以为不见
就能平静地度过一天
又一天
然后一年
又一年
直到石板桥上
彼此的名字
终于模糊成了一个句点

燕子飞了，落了
明晰的回忆
被无奈刺破
谎言
还是占领了湖面

又是一年春天
离人桥上
堆满了融化的思念
每一滴
都是杜鹃的血


The maple leaves are red and falling
With the pattering of thoughts
How to see
It's like a poem sent
Because she
Was my most beautiful belief

This thousands of water and mountains
Will eventually stop a thousand words and a thousand words
The most important person
Can't beat a million miles and a lie
Hitting the space bar
Thinking you'll understand
--I thought you'd understand

When you look at the pale moon
The dark night where even the stars are dim
When you have passed by this old street
In a world that is familiar and strange

Thinking that if you don't see
You can spend the day in peace
One day after another
And then a year
And another year
Until on the stone bridge
Each other's name
Finally blurred into a full stop

Swallows fly and fall
Clear memories
Pierced by helplessness
Lies
Still occupying the lake

It's spring again
On the bridge of leaving people
Piled up with melting thoughts
Each drop
Is the blood of the cuckoo
