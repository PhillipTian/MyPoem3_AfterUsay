青山
云翳也披上
那晚霞烂漫
颠倒在
岁月里
时光的谎言
眼前的荒野
————
峨眉
荒野披上
翠绿的思念
思念
流水划过山涧
思念
歌声萦回山间
思念
那些走丢的梦
和你
一同消失在眼前
我一定
一定要
寻回这一切
————
峨眉
我们顶峰相见！


Green Mountain
The clouds are also clothed
The evening sunlight
Upside down in
in the years
The lie of time
The wilderness in front of my eyes
----
Ebony
The wilderness draped with
green thoughts
Thoughts of
Flowing water cutting through the mountain stream
Thoughts of
Song echoes in the mountains
Thoughts of
Those lost dreams
With you
Disappearing together with you
I must
I must
find all this
----
Emei
See you at the top!
