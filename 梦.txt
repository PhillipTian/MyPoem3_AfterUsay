当行人仰望天空
你的背影
田垄上
泛黄的旧梦；
也曾仰望天空
你的背影
像是我的梦

当诗人仰望天空
沉默的月亮
吞一杯温酒
换一场不醒的梦
窗边吹来蔚蓝色的风
你却消失在我的天空

我仰望天空
一滴眼泪噙留在你的以后
以后我还要仰望天空
直到为你留下的梦
不会作痛

When pedestrians look up at the sky
Your back
on a field monastery
Yellowing old dreams.
Have also looked up to the sky
Your back
Like a dream for me

When the poet looked up at the sky
The silent moon
Swallowing a glass of warm wine
For a dream that won't wake up
A blue wind blows at the window
But you disappeared from my sky

I look up at the sky
A tear is left in your future
I will look up to the sky again
Until the dream left for you
Won't hurt
