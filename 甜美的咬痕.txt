                           【甜美的咬痕】
(AWSL我怎么能写这么羞耻的句子...<o~o>)

序言

一段身姿
背后
几个故事

一双玉手
原来
衣冠禽兽

正文

时光
磨平岁月的棱角
鲜血
沾染青葱的音容
你要的答案
这身后的一切
是我胸口难以言述的痛楚
看向镜子里的自己
那双麻木不仁
刻上原罪的双手
我，不敢直视你的眼眸
索性忘却
亲族的血为何而流

成片乌鸦
掠过古堡塔尖
像一个个拉丁字符
细数着前世
你我的罪过
谁
还记得那流泪的晚风
夕阳下
洛府城门上
镌刻着'`很久，很久``

我爱你的背叛
你的小心思
怕我，侵犯
你红娇艳欲滴的嘴唇
白色的制服，衬着你的魅力
你闪烁而直视的眼睛
让人经不住诱惑
一颗颗撕掉的纽扣
疯狂地在地上舞动
像一段惊世的天鹅舞
橱窗上的发带
还圈着你来时的温度
波光粼粼的浴缸
残留着你身为白女巫的毒
你诱人的密语
像极了人生告别
每一句都是麻醉过去
和黑色的玫瑰
盛开在黑色的夜
滴滴的水声
像极了你的低吟
我蓦然回首
你却已道一声珍重
阳光透过树叶
陆离斑驳

埋怨当时不该回首
想起那年街角的相拥
忘情地沉醉在你温柔的胸口
原来多像一只迷失的小鹿
在你洛佩斯特家族的迷宫里
找不到出口
为了走进你
那一颗森林般未知的心
我也放弃了所有
你，能否将我紧搂

百年对峙
多少相仇
妄用跨越种族的真爱
化解世代不尽的噩梦
爱你月光下
填满一杯酒
说什么带我远离世仇和腐朽

如果时光
能为我倒流
那甜蜜的咬痕
是早已模糊
交织着多少爱与无奈
而仇恨的颜色
却被淡忘在前夜的星空
我难以忘怀
每一丝你的味道
那森林的最深处
原是一个刑场
死亡，不怕
只要紧紧将你依靠
洛逸,请原谅我最后一次的无理取闹

(AWSL how could I write such a shameful sentence... <o~o>)

Prologue

A body pose
behind the scenes
A few stories

A pair of jade hands
The original
A clothed beast

Main article

time
smoothing the edges of the years
Blood
Stained with the sound of green
The answer you want
All that is behind me
Is the unspeakable pain in my chest
Looking at myself in the mirror
Those insensitive hands
The hands carved with original sin
I don't dare to look into your eyes
I forget
What the blood of my kinsmen is for

Flocks of crows
Sweeping over the spires of the old castle
Like a Latin character
Counting the past lives
The sins of you and me
Who
remembers the evening breeze that weeps
Under the sunset
On the gate of Luofu city
Engraved with ''Long, long time''

I love your betrayal
Your little heart
Afraid of me, violating
Your red and delicate lips
White uniform, lined with your charm
Your twinkling and direct eyes
Make people can't resist temptation
One by one, the torn buttons
Dancing wildly on the floor
Like an amazing swan dance
The hairband on the window
Still circled with the temperature of your arrival
The shimmering bathtub
Your poison as a white witch remains
Your seductive whispers
Like a farewell to life
Every word is anesthesia of the past
And black roses
Blooming in the black night
The sound of dripping water
Like the sound of your whisper
I look back
But you've already said goodbye
Sunlight through the leaves
Dappled and dappled

I complain that I should not have looked back
Thinking of the embrace on the street corner that year
I forgot to indulge in your gentle chest
How I was like a lost deer
In the labyrinth of your Loprest family
Can't find the exit
In order to enter you
The unknown heart of the forest
I've given up everything too
Can you hold me close

A hundred years of confrontation
How many enemies
The true love that crosses race
To resolve the endless nightmares of generations
Love you under the moonlight
Fill up a glass of wine
Saying that it will take me away from worldly enmity and decay

If only time
Could turn back the clock for me
That sweet bite mark
Is already blurred
How much love and helplessness are interwoven
And the color of hatred
But forgotten in the starry sky of the night before
I can't forget
Every trace of your smell
The deepest part of the forest
Was a torture chamber
Death, fear not
Just hold on to you tightly
Royale, please forgive me for being so unreasonable for the last time
